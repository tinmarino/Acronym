An approximate formula for the full width at half power in arcminutes is: Œ∏PB = 45/ŒΩGHz. More precise measurements of the primary beam shape have been derived and are incorporated in AIPS (task PBCOR) and CASA (clean task and the imaging toolkit) to allow for correction of the primary beam attenuation in wide-field images. Objects larger than approximately half this angle cannot be directly observed by the array. However, a technique known as "mosaicing," in which many different pointings are taken, can be used to construct images of larger fields. Refer to References 1 and 2 in Documentation for details.

Virtually all floating point math is done in SSE (and thus XMM registers) in 64 bit mode, so, unlike MMX registers, they are still quite relevant. <br/>See [SEE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions) |
